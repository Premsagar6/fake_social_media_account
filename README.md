There is also the fact that followers bring more followers! Some businesses benefit by purchasing a small amount of followers, resulting in a quick boost of social media presence.

### Pre-Requisites / Technologies Used:-
- Python Programming Language (Intermediate), machine learning
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn and tensorflow

### Step_1: Dataset Cleaning and Data Exploration:-
- Dealing with null values and missing values like is.na() to check them
- Using functions to get familiar with data like info(), describe(), value_counts()
- Visualizing data using graphs like histogram, count-plot, heatmap, displot, etc.

### Step_2: Data Pre-Processing and Training the Model:-
- Performing Scaling: A method used to scale the range of independent variables or features of data
- Performing Normalization: The process of translating data into the range 0 to 1

### Step_3: Measuring the performance of the model:-
- Using Confusion Matrix: "Compares true value with predicted value"
- Acheived Accuracy of 0.96 (96%) xand used different classification report.
